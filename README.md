# ShowRep:
## App used to get info from your [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) replays! 

To start, open the app [TODO: releases and more help will be added later] and enter your replay file [TODO: add other ways of replay input],
then watch the magic!

The app calculates (very naively so far) how lucky you or you opponent were during the battle by a variety of metrics:
- move accuracy
- secondary effect accuracy
- critical hits
- [TODO] there has to be something more

Exemplary analysed replay: (very early and WIP)
